## **Ideas**

- Highway/Lane style gameplay - Guitar Hero/Rock Band/FNF
- Osu! style gameplay
- Overdrive mode to increase point gain as seen in Guitar Hero/Rock Band
- Local Scoreboard
- Online Scoreboard
- Song Charting tool
- Special Elements (e.g Osu Spin Sections, Taiko Drumrolls, Guitar Hero Hammer Ons/Tap Notes)
- 4 main difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)
- Customisation features to change the game’s looks
- Replay system to view previous song attempts
- On Screen Lyrics
- Meter/Percentage to show how much of the song is left
- Gameplay Modifiers (Speed up/Slow down, Full accuracy)
- Maybe multiplayer support?

## **Gameplay Loop**

1. Start playing songs on lower difficulties
2. Eventually master that difficulty and keep going up until you manage to full combo (FC) the song on the hardest difficulty
3. Move on to another song and do the same or keep playing the song to beat your previous score.
