# **Ideas**

player goes though stages and while fighting a dodging enemies then fight a boss

player can unlock and choose new characters as they progress with different attack patters and abilities. and maybe give them random things they can choose from at the end of each stage like a rouge lite. to keep the game play fresh for each run.

we can also add a story if we feel like, lore behind the game.

# **Gameplay Loop**

1. play a stage with enemies
2. fight boss
3. story maybe
4. next stage
5. rinse and repeat
6. until final stage
