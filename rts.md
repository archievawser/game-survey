# **Ideas**

- Combat could be done in a ton of ways, including MOBA style like LOL
- Thousands of units at once
- Cool theme possibilities; futuristic? medieval? fantasy?
- Fun unit ideas (e.g futuristic exo suit guys, medieval kings, fantasy wizards)
- Units cost resources like food/wood/steel/etc
- More advanced and heavy units cost more resources - or rarer resources - to add progression
- Multiplayer
- Unit factories (training barracks? mech factories? hogwarts?)
- Different terrain playstyles: water, lava, sand, road, etc
- Players could build roads on which units travel faster
- A grace period at the start of the game so people have time to prepare and don't just rush each other

# **Gameplay Loop**

1. Use units to harvest/obtain resources
2. Spend resources to either upgrade units or build facilities (walls, labs, turrets, whatever)
3. Attack rivals w/ units and either get defeated or defeat them and gain more resources
4. Use units to harvest/obtain resources
