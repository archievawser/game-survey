# **Ideas**

- Top down
- Probably the hardest to make
- Procedural
- Hardcore
- Bosses with bullet hell mechanics
- Loot tier progression like minecraft & terraria (wood, stone, iron, diamond)
- An ending (escape island? repair spacecraft? die?)
- Limited number of resources in one region to force the player to adventure
- Increasingly difficult waves of enemies each night and a time limit to force the player to finish

# **Gameplay Loop**

1. Adventure to find more resources
2. Use resources to survive; campfires for warmth, food for hunger, water for thirst, building a house, crafting weaponry)
3. Spend remaining resources expanding and working toward beating the game
4. Adventure to find more resources
