# **Ideas**

Probably the easiest to make, doesn’t require much art, add a few building types, a progression system to unlock late game buildings, and maybe a simple ending.

Random raider events would be sick

Could also have random choice events, similar to the game 60 Seconds where a wrong choice can kill everyone (e.g you don't give food to some random guy who visits your colony and he raids you)

There are a lot of cool environments we could make the colony within (a zombie apocalypse? futuristic imperialism? prehistoric? post-extinction event?)

# **Gameplay Loop**

1. Use colonists to increase size of colony and fend off raiders (more farms, labs, whatever building types)
2. Struggle to maintain enough resources (food, water, money, happiness?) to keep colonists alive
3. Fend off raiders
4. Get more colonists (pregnancies or random events)
5. Use colonists to increase size of colony and fend off raiders
