# **Ideas**

Could be SUPER bullet hell-y, boss fights, a ton of enemies at once, crazy attacks.

Like 100 procedural dungeon levels, each one harder, a boss fight every 20 levels or something, treasure chests, NPC vendor selling potions (healing, combat, whatever) that are exchanged for gold dropped by enemies

Each death could send the player back to the last checkpoint and cost them all of their gold, maybe a checkpoint every 5 levels so it gets more stressful as you get further from the checkpoint

# **Gameplay Loop**

1. Clear out next dungeon level / beat next boss
2. Gather loot (gold and items)
3. Interact with NPC vendor and buy better stuff if he is in that dungeon
4. Clear out next dungeon level / beat next boss
