# **Ideas**

- Combat could be made similar to a bullet hell
- Enemies come in waves of increasing difficulty
- Each kill earns the player a certain amount of currency
- Currency is used to buy better defense - guns, gear, turrets, whatever
- 2D or 2.5D and top-down
- Different maps for progression
- Players need to maintain food, water, meds, and general living resources to stay alive similar to a survival game
- Multiplayer (genuinely so fun to code - we can use valve’s [Steamworks.NET](http://Steamworks.NET "‌") for free multiplayer with player-hosted servers)
- We can publish on steam
- Open voice chat
- Easy gameplay to make - only requires enemy AI, a player controller, building, and combat
- Players can be revived when downed
- Boss events (huge health, damage and special attacks, dropping good loot)
- A lot of different opportunities for enemy types. Zombies? Humans? Aliens?

# **Gameplay Loop**

1. Prepare for incoming wave by using currency to purchase defensive items, whether it be guns, placing turrets, better armor, etc.
2. Use gear to defeat wave - some players may die
3. Collect currency from wave
4. Repair and upgrade base
5. Prepare for incoming wave by using currency to purchase defensive items, whether it be guns, placing turrets, better armor, etc.
